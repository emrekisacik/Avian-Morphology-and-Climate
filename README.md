# Analysis of Adaptive Relationships Between Avian Morphology and Climate

As a form of adaptation, organisms exhibit morphological variation in response to surrounding environmental conditions. In animals, body size is a common example of such adaptive traits. Combining my research interest in evolutionary biology with my personal fascination with birds, I designed this project to analyze how avian morphology varies in response to different climatic conditions. 

The project focuses on key body size traits, including body mass, wing size, and limb length. The data will be obtained from AVONET, a publicly available database of avian research, which contains measurements of morphological traits and habitat ranges across thousands of bird species. As for the climatic conditions, annual mean temperature and precipitation are taken into account. The data will be obtained from WorldClim, a global database of climate variables.

I expect to reveal significant correlations between certain body traits and climatic conditions. Specifically, I expect species from low-temperature climates to exhibit larger body sizes and shorter limb lengths, as such traits help maintain internal body temperature in cold environments.
